<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    BingoBongo testing is a simple but efficient, explorative test methodology to <strong>find issues</strong> and
    <strong>have fun</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>
    BingoBongo works best if you focus on an specific part or feature of your application.<br/>
    Simply adapt this <a href='BingoBongoTemplate.pptx'>template</a> to your test case.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    Invite the testers
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4-8 persons</li>
        <li>depending on the complexity of the feature to be tested the meeting should take 1h-1.5h</li>
        <li>make sure everybody has access to the application</li>
        <li>make sure everybody is able to share the screen</li>
    </ul>

<h3>The Meeting</h3>
    <p>
    Every BingoBongo meetings strictly follows the same rules.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial presentation done by the moderator
            <ul>
                <li>The Goal</li>
                <li>The Rules</li>
                <li>Introduction / Demo of the feature that will be tested (either by the moderator, a developer or requirements expert)</li>
                <li>Known Issues & Test focus</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>The Game
            <ul>
                <li>Everybody tests on his own</li>
                <li>If you find something - shout <span style="font-size: 1.5em">'<span style="color: #00769c">Bingo</span><span style="color: #e75013">Bongo</span>’</span></li>
                <li>Everyone stops working; the Finder shares his/her screen and presents the finding</li>
                <li>If everyone agrees, the Finder has to create an issue in the bugtracker.
                    After the issue is created, the finder gets a point</li>
                <li>repeat</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>The Winner is
            <ul>
                <li>Have a final look at the results and congratulation</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3>Why it works</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Competition makes the testers focus on the work during the limited time</li>
        <li>Experience shows, that many more issues are detected during a BingoBongo session compared to conventional testing</li>
        <li>Sharing where an issue was found leads the testers to explore workflows they have not considered before</li>
        <li>To get an advantage, testers try out alternatives besides main workflows</li>
        <li>The session should be competitive, but fair: Tester should exchange working examples of test data</li>
        <li>We found that even end users like to take part in BingoBongo sessions</li>
    </ul>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
    The first BingoBongo testsession was held at 2019-10-10 between 14:15-15:30 somewhere in Leverkusen/Germany. There was
    only a short team attending to this session - in fact Wiebke Hoehn, Maik Zielinsky, Frank Augustin and me did this
    (for a screenshot fof the invitation for this session see below).<br/>
    This first session was not named BingoBongo; the name was used for all following sessions.
